# Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Overview**

Credit card fraud detection is a binary classification problem where the goal is to identify fraudulent transactions among a large number of legitimate ones. Due to the extreme class imbalance, the challenge lies in accurately detecting rare fraud cases while minimizing false alarms.

This project follows a structured machine learning pipeline including data acquisition, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training & testing, and model evaluation.
